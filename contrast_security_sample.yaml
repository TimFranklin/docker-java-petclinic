# Use the properties in this section to control the way and frequency
# with which the agent communicates to logs and the Contrast UI.

agent:

  # Set the amount of time to run the agent before shutting down itself
  # (in milliseconds). A negative value disables scheduled shutdown.
  # shutdown_time_ms: NEEDS_TO_BE_SET

  
  # ============================================================================
  # agent.logger
  # Define the following properties to set logging values.
  # If the following properties are not defined, the
  # agent uses the logging values from the Contrast UI.
  # ============================================================================
  logger:

    # Enable diagnostic logging by setting a path to a log file.
    # While diagnostic logging hurts performance, it generates
    # useful information for debugging Contrast. The value set here
    # is the location to which the agent saves log output. If no
    # log file exists at this location, the agent creates a file.
    #  
    # Example - */opt/Contrast/contrast.log* creates a log in the
    # */opt/Contrast* directory, and rotates it automatically as needed.
    # path: ./contrast_agent.log

    # Set the the log output level. Valid options are
    # `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, and `TRACE`.
    # level: ERROR

    # Set to `true` to redirect all logs to
    # `stdout` instead of the file system.
    # stdout: false

    # Set to `true` to redirect all logs to `stderr` instead of
    # the file system. May be combined with the corresponding
    # `stdout` configuration to write to both streams.
    # stderr: false
